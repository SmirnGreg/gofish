    "## Get the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we use the lovely data of 12CO J=3-2 emission from TW Hya, presented in [Huang et al. (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...852..122H). This can downloaded from the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PXDKBC), we'll need the `dataverse_TWHya_CO_cube.fits` cube. Make sure it's in the same directory as this Notebook if you want to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "TW Hya is a good source to start with as it's near face-on inclination mean that we can assume that the disk is essentially a razor thing 2D disk. In addition the geomtrical parameters are very well known.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading the data is as simple as firing up `GoFish` and passing it the path of the fits cube to `imagecube`."
