.. header:: *Fishing for molecular lines in protoplanetary disks.*

``gofish`` is a set of Python tools to exploit the known rotation of a protoplanetary disk to shift all emission to a common line center in order to stack them, increasing the signal-to-noise of the spectrum, detecting weaker lines, or super-sampling the spectrum to better resolve the line profile.
